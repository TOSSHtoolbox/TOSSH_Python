This repository is a first attempt to translate TOSSH (A Toolbox for Streamflow Signatures in Hydrology; Gnann et al., 2021) into Python. The current version does not contain all signatures, has not been extensively tested and could be optimized in terms of code structure and efficiency, as it currently largely follows the Matlab structure.

## Get in touch
If you are interested in translating TOSSH to Python, please get in touch! We are not actively working on this at the moment, but will gradually add more features and welcome any collaboration to speed this up. 


## Calling TOSSH from Python
If you are a Python user and want to use TOSSH, there is the possibility to call TOSSH from Python using the Matlab Engine, see [here](https://github.com/TOSSHtoolbox/TOSSH/blob/master/example/workflow_TOSSH_with_Python.py)!
